Using a specific example, interrogate the proposition that "any help is better than no help".

- Large Scale Disasters


A crisis requires skills, specific in a wide range of areas.
Social
Economic
Political
Cultural
Medical
Leadership

People think they should respond regardless of the situation.

Depends on the offer of help: 
Does the person have the required skills needed to actually be helpful?
How can a person utilise skills they have to actually be helpful?
Judge the situation to determine the usefulness of individuals?

Varied number of possible situations, different teams with different skills are likely to be useful.

Predictability?

Money is often the best form to assist with a situation.

Women/children are most vunerable vs men.

## Key Points ##

People might be able to do better than you, RECOGNISE

Only ask people to do what you would do for yourself

Understand the most prominent issues of a problem, address these with a quick and efficient style, whilst spending time analysing the most appropriate action for the less critical issues to ensure a lack of conflict.

Assessment is to an extent critical, especially in a medical emergency failure to do so could result in a waste of money or death (Redmond)

If you go to a country, you must follow the leadership of the country.

Often sending search + rescue teams across the world make little to no difference and cost alot vs medical teams (assessing the response is key).

Attempting to maintain integrity/credibility, generate more experience to gain following.

KPS:

Practice what you preach.

Be collaberative not competitive.

Don't lead from the back.

Be aware of dangers, be aware of risks.

Allow people to make their own decisions when following leadership.

Difficult decisions don't take them likely, listen to everyones point of view.

You can't be everybodies friend, you are not one of the gang.

Don't need to be a macho leader, lead people along gently.

## Answer ##

I think it is key to ensure that the situation is carefully but efficiently examined to ensure that the help provided is both timely and useful to the effort. As Professor Redmond [1] referenced to the example of the Haiti earthquake where a group of search and rescue team were sent at a significant cost to the UK to save 3 lives. It is likely that this significant investment could have been spent more effectively and potentially saved a considerably larger number of lives.

In 2009 the Sumatra quake effected a large portion of Indonesia and the UN Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported to the BBC [2] at the time “Compared to the extent of the damage, you see there should be more equipment, more people to do this.” This incident in someway supports the statement, as had more equipment and people been available it is possible medical help and supplies may have been able to reach citizens quicker. However as Redmond mentioned the additional unskilled help might have used up a number of these supplies preventing them getting them to where they are needed most. This leaves us with a need for a decisive and experienced leader to ensure that the best balance is achieved.

As mentioned by Daniel there is a conflict between Grint [3] and Professor Redmond's leadership styles when addressing critical problems. Grint offers an approach around making fast actions and utilising leaders who have very strong and clear decisive nature. Whereas Redmond’s is much more focused on hearing everyone’s point of view to come to the best decision. I feel that in order to provide the best possible help a combination of both leadership styles is required. This would allow initial movements to be made quickly and effectively but ensure that long-term considerations are taken into account when discussing larger plans. 

In conclusion I believe that the statement "any help is better than no help" is not true, disorganised help or aid may cause immediate issues such as in the case mentioned by James of John Travolta’s plane blocking other forms of help all together at the airport. This form of help is counterproductive to all of the efforts being made by official organisations.

The point of both Grint and Redmond having different understanding of critical problems is a very interesting point. I do support Erjun's point that Grint's leadership style is in a number of instances where action needs to be taken immediately a very important initial step. However I feel that in order to get the most optimal outcome the style of leadership needs to be consistently reviewed.

Grint [1] does touch on the fact that problem is quite capable of shifting around the boundaries between that of a critical, tame and wicked problem. And I believe that it would be most effective to follow Grint's command focus approach whilst the problem is critical. Whereas in areas of the problem which are more wicked Redmonds more considered approach is much more likely to be effective in delivering the best result depending on what the situation is.

## Third ##

I support some points raised by both Abdullah and Alisdair and disagree with some of Farah's points. As mentioned by Redmond [1] in the case of an earthquake you are more likely to be rescued by your neighbours than someone from a distant country. In this case the immediate untrained help bears a significant impact on the disaster count. Waiting hours or even days for help could potentially increase the fatality count by a significant margin. In this case the help is less of a burden than that of someone travelling directly to the incident from another country with no experience as the neighbour is potentially already in place to help.

However in the case that emergency responses and trained teams reached the victims at a fast response rate which may be expected in a first world country I would support Farah as it is likely that the untrained help would get in the way and expose them to additional danger.
