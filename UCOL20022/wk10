Tyndall? - Inter disciplinery climate change band

Putting forward a case for changing the climate.

Argues as climate change is a special issue with two key issues:

Will make problems with food and water worse in the future.
With climate change we only have a very short window to act.

Everything we do influences future climate, the decisions we make now will impact the future.

Two key options, mitgate now, adapt less later or don't mitigate but be prepared to change later.

If the global increase in temperature was to increase by 2 degrees.

Corals will die, more extreme weather, increased water stress, coastal flooding.

1988 when the climate change panel was created to internationally recognise the issue.

Currently we are on trend for a low miti and high adapt. Potentially dangerous, question!!!?

The UK cut needs to be 80%???! no way hosay...

Is it appropriate for poorer countries to have a bigger emission budget. The wealthier nations can then take the initial brunt of the reduction.

4 degrees is a possibility and it is also potentially beyond our adaptation possibilities. Add to this the devastation to the eco-systems and the instability of the temperatature.

The future appears impossible as we can't mitigate for 2-4 degree change but we cannot adapt past 4 degrees.

To make a difference 40% - 60% reduction from 1% - 5% of the population. This could be achieved through policy.

Technology could be used to optimise the energy path and save some energy on the route from power station to fridge light.

By improving increased efficiency for cars we could reduce by 40-50%

300 Billion to retrofit 2 thirds of the UK's housing. Would reduce fuel poverty, energy bills, vulnerability to volatile energy prices. Could have done this, instead gave the money to the bank.

We need to move on from the twentieth century to resolve these new challenges.

Global issue with global response.

Everyone is on board with the idea of climate change but there is no legally binding agreement with all the key participants. 1992 to 2015

Very complex problem.

UNFCCC started in 1995 95 parties, separated into Annex 1 (Developed nations), Annex 2, Non Annex 1 (Least developed nations + developing)

There are 1,700 'observer organisations' watching the process of the conferences.

There is a regular conference of parties (COP) every 2 years.

Annex 1 has reduction targets, Non Annex 1 has peak emission targets.

Leaders have many challenges, metrics can be skewed in many ways to display results in many different ways.

Leaders need to assess where the blame lies, who has been the worst in the past? 
What kind of level of development should be permitted?
Should levels be considered per capita or per person?
And many many more.

And all 195 participants will need to agree, almost an impossible task!!!

Unilateral Action, effectively the EU setting targets which will hope others will follow.
Bilateral Agreements: US/China agreement to lower climate change.

### Answer One ###

I share the same opinion as many of the other participants in that Climate Change is most certainly a shared problem and that a collaberation of all the parties mentioned should be working together to reduce the effect of climate change on the planet. 

As Maria mentioned in her lecture there is a key choice of changing now and adapting less later or doing very little now and adapting significantly later down the line. I feel this choice is key to who bears the main responsibility of handling the effects of climate change. Currently stricter policies made by political leaders and businesses to addressing the issue now, would have the effect on reducing the adaptation required in the future. This situation is likely to place responsibility on scientists to develop solutions to the change in climate and rely on individuals to adapt.

Currently the situation is very similar to that mentioned by Grint [1] in which we are stuck in a state of delaying making a firm decision to continue to research and consult for the best result. As Christopher Jones mentioned in his part of the lecture, the Copenhagen conference in 2009 was supposed to be a key decision making conference. The result however as explained by Bodansky [2] was an agreement called the Copenhagen accord which had a number of key agreed points. But was unable to be adopted by the conference and instead was simply 'noted'.

I feel that currently there is a significant responisibilty on politicians as our democratic leaders to utilise their inflence and resources to attempt to produce a best case solution for the good of the world. As mentioned by Mary Robinson a UN envoy [3] in an interview, the worlds government have come to solutions on major issues before and it is their job to come to an agreement and work respectively in their countries to ensure that the agreement is followed.

Additionally as it has been mentioned by my peers it is just as important to realise our own responsibilities as individuals, collectives and businesses and to lead ourselves, friends and customers to make the biggest difference we can, as our own actions are shaping the future for ourselves and others and based on the progress of politics over the last 20 years, the solution may be too late.
